I don't have any skills currently available. The system shows an empty list of available skills.

Skills are specialized capabilities that can be invoked for specific tasks like working with PDFs, spreadsheets, or other document types. When skills are installed, they would appear in my available tools and I can use them to help with relevant tasks.

If you'd like to add skills or use specific capabilities, you may need to configure them in your Claude Code settings. You can check the Claude Code documentation for information on how to set up and use skills.
