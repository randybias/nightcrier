# Change: Optimize Integrations (Phase 5)

## Why
To improve the quality of reports and agent capabilities after the core system is stable.

## What Changes
- Implement `integrations` capability (enhancements):
    - Richer Slack notifications (file uploads vs links).
    - Advanced agent prompts (few-shot examples).
    - Support for additional agent backends.

## Impact
- **Modified Capabilities**: `reporting`, `agent-runtime`.
- **New Code**: Slack file upload logic, prompt template engine updates.
